     "shortContent": "<p>Neuroscience has discovered the remarkably simple source for endless self-motivation. We can do anything we set our minds to. But sometimes it can feel like our brains are working against us when it comes to achieving our goals. Plans to learn a new skill, get in shape, or to save money and start a business, keep getting pushed back in the hopes that Future You will handle it “someday.” It’s a crippling behavioral cycle. In fact, in psychology, procrastination is classified as a form of self-sabotage.</p>"

You can only really know if you taste the cake yourself. You won’t know how motivating, clarifying, and empowering it is until you experience it yourself. Your identity and personality are shaped by your behavior. Change your choices, change your life. Will waking up early sometimes suck?<p>"
